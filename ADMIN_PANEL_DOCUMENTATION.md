## Overview

The Admin Panel is a comprehensive management interface for the Dice Betting Game. It provides full control over game rounds, dice results, user management, financial operations, and system settings.

**Base URL:** `http://159.198.46.36:8001/game-admin/`

**Main Features:**
- Real-time game monitoring and control
- Dice result management (manual and random modes)
- User and wallet management
- Deposit request approval/rejection
- Transaction history tracking
- Game settings configuration
- Admin user management with granular permissions

---

## Access & Authentication

### Login Page
**URL:** `/game-admin/login/`

**Authentication Logic:**
1. User must be authenticated via Django's authentication system
2. User must have admin privileges (`is_staff=True` or `is_superuser=True`)
3. Login uses Django's `authenticate()` and `login()` functions
4. After successful login, redirects to dashboard

**Login Process:**
```python
# From admin_views.py - admin_login()
1. Check if user is already authenticated and is admin → redirect to dashboard
2. On POST:
   - Get username and password from form
   - Authenticate user with Django's authenticate()
   - Check if user is admin using is_admin() helper
   - If admin: login user and redirect to dashboard
   - If not admin: show "no permission" error
   - If invalid credentials: show "invalid username or password" error
```

**Logout:**
- **URL:** `/game-admin/logout/`
- Uses Django's `logout()` function
- Clears session and redirects to login page

---

## User Roles & Permissions

### Role Types

- **Access:** Full access to all features
- **Permissions:** All permissions automatically granted
- **Special Access:**
  - Game Settings (only super admins)
  - Admin Management (only super admins)
  - Django Admin panel link

#### 2. Regular Admin (Staff)
- **Check:** `user.is_staff == True`
- **Access:** Controlled by `AdminPermissions` model
- **Permissions:** Granular permission system

### Permission System

**Model:** `AdminPermissions` (One-to-One with User)

**Available Permissions:**
```python
can_view_dashboard = True          # View main dashboard
can_control_dice = True            # Control dice results

can_view_players = True           # View players/users
can_view_deposit_requests = True  # View deposit requests
can_view_transactions = True      # View transactions
can_view_game_settings = False     # Game settings (super admin only)
can_view_admin_management = False  # Admin management (super admin only)
```

**Permission Logic:**
```python
# From admin_utils.py
def is_admin(user):
    - Must be authenticated
    - Must be superuser OR staff
    - If AdminProfile exists, must be active

def has_menu_permission(user, permission_name):
    - Super admins: Always True
    - Regular admins: Check AdminPermissions model

## Game Logic & Round Management

### Round Lifecycle

**Round States:**
1. **WAITING:** Round created but not started
2. **BETTING:** Betting is open (0 to BETTING_CLOSE_TIME seconds)
3. **CLOSED:** Betting closed, waiting for result (BETTING_CLOSE_TIME to DICE_RESULT_TIME)
4. **RESULT:** Result announced (DICE_RESULT_TIME to ROUND_END_TIME)
5. **COMPLETED:** Round ended, new round can start

**Round Creation:**
- Created automatically by game timer
- Round ID format: `R{timestamp}` (e.g., R1705123456)
- Status starts as 'BETTING'
- Timer starts at 1 second

**Round Completion:**
- When timer reaches ROUND_END_TIME
- Status changes to 'COMPLETED'
- end_time is set
- New round is created automatically

### Winning Number Calculation

**Logic:**
```python
# From utils.py - determine_winning_number()
1. Count frequency of each number (1-6) in dice values
2. Find maximum frequency
3. Get all numbers with max frequency (ties)
4. Return highest number among ties

Example:
- Dice: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
- Frequencies: {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}
- Max frequency: 3
- Winning number: 3

Example with tie:
- Dice: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
- Frequencies: {1:2, 2:2, 3:1, 4:1}
- Max frequency: 2
- Tied numbers: [1, 2]
- Winning number: 2 (highest)
```

### Payout Calculation

**Logic:**
```python
# From views.py - calculate_payouts()
1. Get all bets for the round
2. Count frequency of each number in dice values
3. Determine winning number (most frequent, highest on tie)
4. For each bet:
   - If bet.number == winning_number:
     - Count how many times winning_number appears in dice
     - Calculate payout based on frequency:
       - 1 occurrence: 2x bet amount
       - 2 occurrences: 3x bet amount
       - 3 occurrences: 4x bet amount
       - 4 occurrences: 5x bet amount
       - 5 occurrences: 6x bet amount
       - 6 occurrences: 7x bet amount
     - Set is_winner = True
     - Set payout_amount = calculated payout
     - Credit user's wallet with payout
     - Create WIN transaction
   - Else:
     - Set is_winner = False
     - Set payout_amount = 0
5. Save all bets
```

**Payout Ratios:**
- Based on frequency of winning number in dice
- Higher frequency = higher payout multiplier
- Stored in settings as `PAYOUT_RATIOS`

---

## Dice Control System

### Dice Modes

#### Manual Mode
- Admin must manually set dice values
- Dice values set via Dice Control page
- No automatic rolling
- Full control over results

#### Random Mode
- Dice values generated automatically
- Uses `generate_random_dice_values()` function
- Random values for each of 6 dice
- Winning number calculated from random values

**Mode Toggle:**
- Stored in `GameSettings` with key `dice_mode`
- Values: `'manual'` or `'random'`
- Can be toggled from Dice Control page

### Setting Dice Values

**Individual Dice Setting:**
- Set each of 6 dice independently (1-6)
- Values can be different
- Winning number calculated from all 6 dice
- Supports partial updates in Manual Adjust mode

**All Dice Same Value (Legacy):**
- Set all 6 dice to same number
- Used for simple testing
- Still supported for backward compatibility

**Time Restrictions:**
- Normal mode: Can only set before DICE_RESULT_TIME
- Manual Adjust mode: Can set at any time
- Timer checked from round start_time

**Validation:**
- Each dice value must be 1-6
- All 6 values required (unless Manual Adjust mode)
- Invalid values show error message

---

## Settings Management

### Game Settings Model
- Key-value storage
- Settings stored in database
- Can be updated via admin panel
- Read dynamically (no caching)

### Available Settings

**Timing Settings:**
- `BETTING_CLOSE_TIME`: Seconds when betting closes (default: 30)
- `DICE_ROLL_TIME`: Seconds when dice roll starts (default: 19)
- `DICE_RESULT_TIME`: Seconds when result announced (default: 51)
- `ROUND_END_TIME`: Total round duration (default: 70)

**Mode Settings:**
- `dice_mode`: 'manual' or 'random'

**Payout Settings:**
- `PAYOUT_RATIOS`: Dictionary mapping frequency to multiplier
  - Stored in settings.py (not in database)

### Settings Reading Logic

```python
# From utils.py - get_game_setting()
1. Query GameSettings model for key
2. If found: return value (convert to int if numeric)
3. If not found: fallback to settings.py GAME_SETTINGS dict
4. Always reads fresh (no caching)
```

**Why No Caching:**
- Settings can change during runtime
- Game timer reads settings on each iteration
- Changes should apply immediately
- No server restart needed

---

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- Django framework
- Django REST Framework for APIs
- Django Channels for WebSocket
- Redis for caching and channel layer
- PostgreSQL/SQLite database

**Frontend:**
- Server-side rendered HTML templates
- JavaScript for real-time updates
- AJAX polling for dashboard updates
- WebSocket for game events

### Database Models

**GameRound:**
- Stores round information
- Fields: round_id, status, dice_result, dice_1-6, timestamps
- Related: Bet, DiceResult

**Bet:**
- Stores user bets
- Fields: user, round, number, chip_amount, payout_amount, is_winner
- Unique constraint: (user, round, number)

**AdminPermissions:**
- Stores admin user permissions
- One-to-One with User
- Boolean fields for each permission

**GameSettings:**
- Key-value storage for settings
- Fields: key, value, description

**Transaction:**
- Financial transaction history
- Fields: user, type, amount, balance_before, balance_after

**DepositRequest:**
- User deposit requests
- Fields: user, amount, screenshot, status, processed_by

### Redis Integration

**Usage:**
- Store current round data
- Store round timer
- Channel layer for WebSocket
- Fast read/write for real-time updates

**Round Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "round_id": "R1705123456",
  "status": "BETTING",
  "start_time": "2025-01-12T10:30:00Z",
  "timer": 25,
  "dice_result": null,
  "dice_1": null,
  "dice_2": null,
  ...
}
```

**Sync Logic:**
- Database is source of truth
- Redis synced from database
- Timer calculated from start_time
- Updates happen in both places

### WebSocket Broadcasting

**Channel Group:** `game_room`

**Message Types:**
- `game_start`: New round started
- `game_timer`: Timer update
- `dice_roll`: Dice roll animation start
- `dice_result`: Dice result announced
- `game_end`: Round ended

**Broadcasting Logic:**
```python
# From admin_views.py and start_game_timer.py
1. Get channel layer
2. Send message to 'game_room' group
3. All connected clients receive update
4. Frontend updates UI accordingly
```

### Security

**Authentication:**
- Django session-based authentication
- CSRF protection enabled
- Login required for all admin pages

**Authorization:**
- Permission checks on every page
- Decorators: `@admin_required`, `@super_admin_required`
- Menu items hidden based on permissions

**Data Protection:**
- User passwords hashed (Django's password hashers)
- Sensitive operations logged
- Admin actions tracked (processed_by fields)

### Error Handling

**Common Errors:**
- Invalid dice values: Shows error, redirects back
- Timer restrictions: Shows error with time limit
- No active round: Shows error message
- Permission denied: Redirects to login or shows error

**Error Messages:**
- Displayed via Django messages framework
- Shown at top of page
- Auto-dismiss after few seconds (via JavaScript)
